At least one of my chosen inventions must be a major invention. I immediately gain the gadgets without expending the resources, having been assumed to have been working on them for some time. Some gadgets require a saving throw called my Gadget DC, and it is equal to 8 + my proficiency bonus + my Intelligence modifier. I learn how to craft an additional gadget of my choice at 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level. A major invention is a gadget which is either permanent, or a single use consumable. If they were used, consumable major gadgets replenish after a long rest, at no cost. A minor invention is a consumable gadget that I have a handful of at any given time. For each minor gadget I know how to make, I have a number of equal to half my Intelligence modifier rounded up (minimum 1). Minor gadgets replenish up to this maximum limit after a long rest, at no cost. During a short rest, I may create one minor gadget of a type of my choosing, up to my maximum at no cost, but may not work on anything else during this time. Minor Gadgets beyond my free limit may be created, taking 1 hour of work and 100 gp of supplies per additional gadget created. If the gadget is an arrow, it is fired normally from a bow and deals its regular damage in addition to any listed effects. If I miss with an arrow, its effect is still consumed on impact. Arrows can be substituted with bolts for a crossbow, and weigh the same as normal ammunition. It takes an Investigation check against my Gadget DC to tell that these are non-standard arrows or bolts.",

Upon landing, I take no damage and the chute flops down behind me. As an action I can pull a cord again and stuff it back into the pack. If I'm about to be hit with a melee or ranged attack, I may pull the chute as a reaction, orienting it towards the attack’s origin. The parachute bursts out and detaches from the pack, intercepting and preventing the attack, but will be damaged and need repair. Additionally, if the source of the attack was within 15 ft, the attacker is restrained and blinded by the parachute wrapped around them. A target restrained and blinded by the parachute may take an action to free themselves and end the effects. The parachute has an AC of 10 and 20 hit points. If the parachute hits 0 hit points, I fall, but only take half of the damage from the fall, and the parachute will require a repair. If the parachute is damaged, I repair it after a long rest.

This increase lasts for 1 minute, after which, I begin to descend as normal. I replenish my alchemical lift formula after a long rest.

Additionally, once I’ve attuned to it, I can never lose it, as it will always find its way back to my hands. The coin has also taken on the eerie ability to predict favourable outcomes. Ask the coin a yes or no question, or present it a binary decision, labelling the outcomes to either heads or tails, and flip the coin.

While controlling the mechanid, I may see and hear as if I were the spider, although I count as deaf and blind for my own body if I do so. I may only have one mechanid active at a time.

Upon landing, I take no damage and the chute flops down behind me. As an action I can pull a cord again and stuff it back into the pack. If I'm about to be hit with a melee or ranged attack, I may pull the chute as a reaction, orienting it towards the attack’s origin.

A target restrained and blinded by the parachute may take an action to free themselves and end the effects. The parachute has an AC of 10 and 20 hit points. If the parachute hits 0 hit points, I fall, but only take half of the damage from the fall, and the parachute will require a repair. If the parachute is damaged, I repair it after a long rest.
